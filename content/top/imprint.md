## Disclaimer
Liability for Content
As a service provider (§ 7 Abs.1 TMG) we're responsible for our own website's content. However, we're not responsible to monitor transmitted or submitted information not our own or to actively search for activities that might indicate unlawful activities (§§ 8 bis 10 TMG). This does not affect requirements for removing or making inaccessible information in accordance to applicable law. However, liability may only start once knowledge of a specific violation of law is made known to us. If such a case is made known to us we will comply with lawful requests promptly.

## Liability for Links
Our service offer includes links to third parties which are not under our control. Therefore we cannot accept any liability for the respective third party content. The responsibility and liability for third party content we link to lies with the operator of the respective third party service. We screen third party content we link to at the time we place the link for possible violations of law and make sure that no unlawful content was present at the time. Permanent monitoring of third party resources is an unreasonable burden. Should any unlawful content on a third party website be pointed out to us, we will remove the respective links promptly.

## Copyright & Urheberrecht (DE)
All content created by the website operator is under the explicit copyright and author's right (DE: Urheberrecht) of the website operator. Duplication, editing, dissemination and any use outside copyright regulations and law require written prior consent of the respective author and/or creator. Downloads and copies of this website are permitted for private and personal use only. Any content not created by the website operator is under copyright by its respective authors and creators and will be labeled as such. Should you - despite our best efforts - become aware of a copyright infringement, please let us know. We'll remove such content promptly.
